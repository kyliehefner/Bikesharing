# Bikesharing

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate public data from New York's Citi Bikes. The analysis will be used in the decision on whether to open a new bikesharing company. This analysis focuses on how bike utilization is affected by day of the week, hour of the day, gender of the user, and age of the user. We are investigating how trip duration differs throughout the day, between men and women, and with age. We also want to see when the Citi Bikes are used most often. These conclusions will help inform decisions about pricing, repairs, and more in a new bikesharing business.

**Most Citi Bike trips are about 5 minutes long. The trip duration distribution is skewed to the right. Few trips last over an hour.**

**Male users account for 65.3% of Citibike trips while female users account for 25.1% of trips.**

**The gap between the number of male and female riders decreases as trip duration increases.**

**Younger users tend to use the Citi Bikes for longer. We can also hypothesize that some users are inputting fake birth years (pre-1930).**

**The amount of rides is highest during weekday commuting times (8 am and 5-6 pm). Weekend ride density is equally distributed between 10 am and 6 pm.**

**Male and female riders show similar patterns in the times when they use the citibikes.**

**Customers are slightly more likely to ride on weekends, while Subscribers are slightly more likely to ride on weekdays. Male and female riders show similar distributions of riding days throughout the week.**

## Summary
### Summary of Results
Many Citi Bike trips are very short in length, but the average (about 15 minutes) is skewed higher than the median. Gender does not seem to have a large influence on trip length, although younger users tend to use the Citi Bikes for longer. Density of rides is highest during weekday commuting times and evenly distributed throughout weekend days.
### Additional Visualizations
1. One additional visualization that would be useful for the project is a treemap showing the shares of the most popular start stations. This visualization could help the project team determine how to distribute bikes throughout the city to encourage more ridership.
2. Another potential visualization with this data is a flowmap of the most popular routes through the city. This map would have lines between the start and end stations with the color and density of the lines determined by how many rides used that route. With this visualization we could uncover new conclusions about the movement of bikes through the city.
